# 100 JavaScript Functions

This repository contains solutions of all exercises from 100jsfunctions.com, a website I used while studying JavaScript.
The site contains 100 different exercises covering various JS/programming topics and difficulty levels.

Each file in this repo contains _ONLY the solutions_. 
If you wish to check the questions and/or solve the exercises on your own, visit [100jsfunctions.com](https://www.100jsfunctions.com).

**The content is partitioned by level of difficulty:**

- Beginner exercises (1->25) can be accessed immediately as single files.
- Exercises 26->75 can be accessed from the ```/intermediate``` folder.
- Exercises 76->100 can be accessed from the ```/advanced``` folder.
